# TripTrek Backend (FastAPI + LangChain + LangGraph)

This backend powers the TripTrek application, providing AI-driven travel planning and itinerary generation. It uses **FastAPI** for the API layer, and leverages **LangChain** and **LangGraph** to orchestrate generative AI workflows for building structured travel content.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Technologies

- **FastAPI**  
  A modern, high-performance Python web framework for building APIs with automatic OpenAPI docs.

- **LangChain**  
  A framework for developing applications powered by language models. Used here to structure prompts, parse outputs, and manage the flow of AI-generated travel content.

- **LangGraph**  
  An extension of LangChain for building complex, multi-step, and branching workflows with language models.

- **Google Gemini API**  
  Provides the LLM (Large Language Model) used for generating travel itineraries and recommendations.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

1. **API Endpoint**  
   The main endpoint accepts travel-related parameters (such as destination, interests, duration, etc.).

2. **Itinerary Generation**  
   - The backend uses LangChain prompts and output parsers to instruct the LLM to generate a structured travel itinerary.
   - LangGraph can be used for advanced workflows, such as generating daily plans, recommendations, and summaries.

3. **Output**  
   The endpoint returns a JSON object representing the full itinerary, including destinations, daily plans, activities, recommendations, and summaries.
